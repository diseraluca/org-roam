Sometimes, it might be easier to prove that a statement is false.

Consider statements of the form \(P(x) \implies Q(x)\).
Those statements are [[id:a130c0ad-fb49-4d07-8942-bb4e2435080b][Universal Statements]] where the universal quantifier is implicit.

Hence, the negation of such a statement is "There is x such that P(x) and not Q(x)".

Meaning that instead of a general argument we need a single example to prove that the statement is false.

+ Counterexample :: An example of an object that shows that a statement is false.
