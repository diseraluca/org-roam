+ Implication :: A statement of the form "If P, then Q"

  + Hypothesis :: The part of an implication that stands after the "if" and before the "Q"
  + Conclusion :: The part of an implication that stands after the "then"

An implication "If P, then Q" asserts that when P is true then Q must be true.
Nonetheless, it does not assert anything about the truth or falsity of Q when P is false.

An implication can be written in many ways:

 - P implies Q
 - P \(\implies\) Q
 - P is sufficient for Q
 - P only if Q
 - Q whenever P
 - Q follows from P
 - Q is necessary for P
 - Q provided that P
