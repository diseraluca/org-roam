In [[id:3f232da0-da26-4433-80a8-10d31908a1c2][OU:M208:Unit-A1:Functions:Real Functions]] we saw that a *real function* is a function whose domain and codomain are both subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\).

When specifying a real function during this unit, if the only specification given is a rule, then we understand the domain to be the set of all real numbers for which the rule is applicable and the codomain to be \(\mathbb{R}\).

For example, \(f(x) \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 - x^{2}}\) does not have domain \(\mathbb{R}\) becuase the square root in it is a real number only when  \(4 - x^{2} > 0\).
