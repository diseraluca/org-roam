Since a symmetry is an isometry, it maps \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\) rigidly onto itself, hence it is one-to-one and onto.

A symmetry \(f \in S(F)\), Being one-to-one and onto, has an inverse function \(f^{-1}\).
Moreover, since \(f\) preserves distances and maps \(F\) to itself, so must \(f^{-1}\), which is then a symmetry in \(S(F)\).

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Inverses Property for Symmetries]
Each symmetry $f$ in the set $S(F)$ of symmetries of a

plane figure $F$ has an \textbf{inverse} symmetry $f^{-1}$ in $S(F)$ such that

\begin{equation*}
f \circ f^{-1} = r = f^{-1} \circ f
\end{equation*}
