+ Set :: Collection of objects
   For example:
    * Solutions of a quadratic equation
    * Points on a Circle
    * Vertices of a triangle
    * Points on a plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)
    * Even numbers less than 100
    * Students taking a particular examination
+ Element of a Set :: An object that belongs to the set

No restriction is given on the elements of a Set, but the Set must be specified so that we can discern wether an object is or isn't in the Set.

There are many way to give such a specification.
For example:

 * We can enumerate the members of the Set
   * \(S\) is the set of members in the list \(4, 9, 3, 2\)
 * We can give a visualization of the Set
   * For example we could use a venn diagram

 * We can give a description of its elements
   1. Let \(E\) be the set of all even integers

Some commonly used Sets and their symbols:

 + \(\mathbb{R}\) :: The Set of real numbers
 + \(\mathbb{R}^*\) :: The Set of non-zero real numbers
 + \(\mathbb{Q}\) :: The Set of rational numbers
 + \(\mathbb{Z}\) :: The Set of integers \(\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\)
 + \(\mathbb{N}\) :: The Set of natural numbers \(1, 2, \ldots\)

+ Finite Set :: Set that has a finite number of elements
+ Infinite Set :: Set that has an infinite number of elements

The symbol \(\in\) is used to indicate that an object is an element of a set.
For example, \(7 \in \mathbb{N}\) means that \(7\) is a member of the set of natural numbers.

Conversely, the symbol \(\notin\) identifies an object as not belonging to a certain set.
For example, \(-9 \notin \mathbb{N}\) means that \(-9\) is not a member of the set of natural numbers.
