We've seen in [[id:b9a24444-23bc-4ac9-b1b8-06ee664f15c5][OU:M208:Unit-A1:The Plane]], that each point in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) can be represented as an ordered pair \((x, y)\) with respect to a pair of axes.
A set of such points is called a *Plane Set*

+ Plane Set :: A set of points in \(\)\(\mathbb{R}^2\)
