+ Universal Statement :: A statement of the form "For all x, P".
  * "For all" and similar phrases are called *Universal Quantifier*
  * Written as \(\forall x, P \)

+ Existential Statement :: A statement of the form "There exist x, P".
  * "There exist" and similar phrases are called *Existential Quantifier*
  * Written as \(\exists x, P \)


Universal and Existential statements are correlated by negation, see [[id:4b3532c9-547b-499f-940b-c43a492fbdbe][OU:M208:Unit-A3:Mathematical Statements:Statements And Negations]].

The negation of a universal statement is an existential statement and the negation of an existential statement is a universal statement.
