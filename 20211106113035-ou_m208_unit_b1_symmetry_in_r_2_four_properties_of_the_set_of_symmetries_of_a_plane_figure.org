#+filetags: OU M208 Mathematics Group-Theory Symmetry Plane

- For any plane figure \(F\), we denote the set of all symmetries of \(F\) by \(S(F)\).
- Every figure \(F\) has at least one simmetry, namely the identity symmetry, usually denoted by \(e\).

The set \(S(F)\) has four important properties:
