Consider a circle \(C\) with centre \((a, b)\) and radius \(r\). This
circle is the set of all points \((x, y)\) such that \((x - a)^2 +
(y - b)^2 = r^2\) holds.

We can write this in set notation as \(C = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 :
(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2\}\).
+ Unit Circle :: The circle centered at the origin with radius 1.

The unit circle \(U\) is formed by all points that are at a distance of 1 from the origin.

Thus we can write it as \(U = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x + y = 1\}\).
