\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Restriction of a function]
Let $f : A \rightarrow B$ and let $C$ be a subset of the domain $A$.

Then the function $g : C \rightarrow B$ defined by

\begin{equation*}
g(x) = f(x), \ \text{for}\ x \in C
\end{equation*}

is the \textbf{restriction} of $f$ to $C$
\end{tcolorbox}

Restrictions are useful when we want to concentrate on the behavior of \(f\) over  small part of its domain.

For example, \(f(x) = x^2\) is not one-to-one and doesn't have an [[id:3dc12e32-ae70-4853-826f-5a01f222ddce][OU:Unit-A1:Functions:Inverse Functions]] .
However. if the domain of $f$ is replace with its positive subset, the we obtain a related function with the same rule that is now one-to-one.
