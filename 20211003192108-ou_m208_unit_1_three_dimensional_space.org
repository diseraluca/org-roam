A coordinate system in three-dimensional space uses three mutually perpendicular axis.

 + Mutually Perpendicular :: For any pair of axis, they are perpendicular

To build a three-dimensional space:

 * Choose an origin *O*
 * Choose an x-axis and y-axis that are perpendicular to each other
 * Draw a line perpendicular to the x and y axes. This is the *z-axis*
 * Chose the positive direction of the z-axis so that the x, y and z axes form a right-handed system of axes

    + Right-handed coordinate system :: A system for which holding the thumb, first-finger and second-finger of your right hand such that they are at right angles with each other and labeling them x, y and z, in the same order allows you to turn your hand such that each finger points in the positive direction of the corresponing axis
 * Choose a unit of distance

A point in a three-dimensional space is an ordered triple \((a, b, c)\) of real numbers.
