#+title: Lines:Gradients of two perpendicular lines
#+roam_tags: maths lines geometry gradient

+ The gradients of any two perpendicular lines ( not parallel to the axes ) have product -1.

Consider two lines that are perpendicular and not parallel to the axes. Let A be
the the point where the lines cross, B any point that lies on the lines and is
above and to the right of A, and let C be the point on the other line that is
obtained by rotating B anticlocwise by 90 degrees about A.

Consider p to be the run from A to B and q to be the rise from A to B.

If we rotate the right angled triangle with hypotenuse AB and catheti p and q
anticlockwise by 90 degrees about A, then it will lie exactly above the
right-angled triangle with hypotenuse AB.

It follows that the run from A to C is -q and the rise from A to C is p.

Hence, the gradient of the line trough A and B \( = \frac{q}{p} \) and
the gradient of the line trough A and C \( = -\frac{p}{1} \).

The product of those two gradients is \( \frac{q}{p} \cdot -\frac{p}{q} = -1 \).

*** Example

    Find in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), the equation of the straight line that passes trough the point \((3,5)\)
    and is perpendicular to the line \(y = 2x + 4\).

    Let A be the straight line that passes trough the point \((3,5)\) and its gradient be \(\nabla_A\).
    Let B be the straight line \(y = 2x + 4\) and its gradient be \(\nabla_B = 2\).

    Then:

    \begin{align*}
      \nabla_A\nabla_B &= -1 \\[5pt]
      \nabla_A &= -\frac{1}{\nabla_B} \\[5pt]
      \nabla_A &= -\frac{1}{2} \\[5pt]
    \end{align*}

    Thus the equation of \(A\) has form \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + c\), where \(c\) is a constant.

    Knowing that \(A\) passes trough the point \((3,5)\), we can find \(c\), as follows:

    \begin{align*}
      5 &= -\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3 + c \\[5pt]
      5 &= -\frac{3}{2} + c \\[5pt]
      5 + \frac{3}{2} &=  c \\[5pt]
      \frac{10 + 3}{2} &=  c \\[5pt]
      \frac{13}{2} &=  c \\[5pt]
      c &= \frac{13}{2} \\[5pt]
    \end{align*}

    Thus, the equation of the line passing trough the point \((3,5)\) and perpendicular to the straight line
    with equation \(y = 2x + 4\) is \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{13}{2}\).
