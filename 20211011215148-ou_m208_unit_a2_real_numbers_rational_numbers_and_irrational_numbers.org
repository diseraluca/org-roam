If the lenght of this diagonal is \(x\), then, by [[id:d2840559-6452-4ec8-b052-67325746aff6][Pythagoras' Law]], \(x\) must satisfy the equation \(x^2 = 2\).

Now, suppose that there is a number, say \(x = \frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\)
are positive integers and \(\frac{p}{q}\)  is fraction in the lower terms, that satisfies the equation.

Then it must be true that:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{p^2}{q^2} = 2
\end{equation*}

 from which we derive \(p^2 = 2q^2\) such that \(p^2\) must be an even number and, consequently, \(p\) must be even too.

 Then, it means that we can write \(p\) as \(2r\), where \(r\) is a positive integer.
 Hence, \(x = \frac{2r}{q}\).

 Then, considering that it satisfies the original equation, we have \(\frac{4r^2}{q^2} = 2\).

 Again, this gives \(q^2 = 2r^2\) so that \(q^2\)
 and \(q\) must be even numbers.

 Now, if both \(p\) and \(q\) were even numbers, they would have a common factor of \(2\).
 But this is impossible, since \(\frac{p}{q}\) would not be a fraction in lowest terms.

 Hence, we derive that:

 \begin{tcolorbox}
There is no ration number $x$ such that $x^2 = 2$.
 \end{tcolorbox}

 And thus \(\amthbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}\) as \(\mathbb{R}\) contains numbers that are not in \(\mathbb{Q}\).
