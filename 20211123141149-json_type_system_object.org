One of the two structured types, akin to a map of key-value pairs.

An object is represented as a pair of curly brackets surround zero or
more name-value pairs (also called members).
 * A name is a string that must be followed by a colon, separating it
   from the value.
 * A single comma separates a value from a following name.
 * A value is anything of the types in [[id:27e965e0-db53-4e39-9f9a-c6e01427701e][JSON:Type System]] .

* Grammar

 object <- begin-object [ member ( value-separator member  )* ] end-object
 member <- string name-separator value
