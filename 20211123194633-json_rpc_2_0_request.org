#+title: JSON-RPC:2.0:Request

A Request Object is a [[id:2b6c48db-b918-46db-86be-d1cbdf5f5bef][JSON:Type System:Object]] that has the following members:

 + jsonrpc :: A [[id:40b19f64-f8b5-49ec-9d7b-f095062801df][JSON:Type System:String]] representing the version of [[id:2193ddf4-f5ec-4204-ab78-b8f6cdc772a7][JSON-RPC:2.0]] protocol.

   For JSON-RPC 2.0 it must be precisely ~"2.0"~.

 + method :: A [[id:40b19f64-f8b5-49ec-9d7b-f095062801df][JSON:Type System:String]] containing the name of the method to be invoked,

   Method names that begin with the word /rpc/ followed by a period
   character are reserved for internal use and extensions.

 + params :: A Structured value that holds parameters values to be used during the invocation of the method.

   This member is optional.

 + id :: An identifier established by the Client that must contain either a [[id:40b19f64-f8b5-49ec-9d7b-f095062801df][JSON:Type System:String]], a [[id:18188d0a-f0bd-4e20-84c3-5291da9736c6][JSON:Type System:Number]] or [[id:f7e11bf7-91ea-46e1-b9c4-643bbe508e06][JSON:Type System:Null]].

   This parameter is optional and the Request Object is assumed to be a [[id:7e17801e-eb31-4e80-b723-59d55e62dc05][JSON-RPC:2.0:Request:Notification]] when it is omitted.

    - If the value is a number it should avoid containing a fractional part.

    - The use of null as an id is discouraged as the specification uses such a value to identify a [[id:a42a0131-45f9-4bd2-8727-9bdf29f9674b][JSON-RPC:2.0:Response]] Object with an unknown id.

    This member is used to correlate responses and requests and the Server should respond to a request with a Response Object containing the same id.

- See [[id:7e17801e-eb31-4e80-b723-59d55e62dc05][JSON-RPC:2.0:Request:Notification]] for a special kind of Reqeust Object.
- You can send multiple Request Objects at once trough a [[id:9c855010-37d7-446b-804e-56d8a1222289][JSON-RPC:2.0:Batch]].
