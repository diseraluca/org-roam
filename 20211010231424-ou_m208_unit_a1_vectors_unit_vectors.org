As we've seen in [[id:46141a4a-a4e8-4e95-b22b-ce46e0adbac6][OU:Unit-A1:Vectors:What is a Vector?]], a *unit vector* is a vector with a magnitude of \(1\).

We denote the unit vector with the same direction as the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) as \(\hat{\mathbf{v}}\) and we find it by multiplying the vector by the reciprocal of its magnitude.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Normalizing a Vector]
The unit vector in the same direction as a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is:

\begin{equation*}
\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{v}\right|}\mathbf{v}
\end{equation*}
\end{tcolorbox}
