#+filetags: OU M208 Mathematics Functions Sets Domain

Consider the set \(A = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\).

A function whose domain and codomain are both \(A\) might, for example, be:

\begin{align*}
f : &A \rightarrow A \\
    &x \mapsto 9 - x
\end{align*}

When the domain is small, we can define a rule by listing the image \(f(x)\) of each element.

For example, let \(A = \{0,1,2,3\}\) and \(B = \{2,3,4,5\}\).
We can define \(f : A \rightarrow B\) by the rule:

\begin{equation*}
f(0) = 2
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
f(1) = 2
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
f(2) = 4
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
f(3) = 5
\end{equation*}

The above diagram is a mapping reprenting the above function.
This type of diagram has always the following features:

 * There is /exactly one/ arrow from each element in the domain
 * There may be no arrows, one arrow or several arrows going to an element of the codomain.
