\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Closure Properties For Symmetries]
The set of symmetries $S(F)$ of a plane figure $F$ is \textbf{closed} under composition of functions.

For all elements $f$ and $g$ of $S(F)$,

the composite $g \circ f$ is an element of $S(F)$
\end{tcolorbox}

There are some interesting properties when composing the symmetries of a figure \(F\):

- If \(f, g \in S(F)\), then \(g \circ f\) may or may not be equal to \(f \circ g\), that is, the composition of symmetries is not commutative.
- Composition of rotational and reflectional symmetries follows a standard pattern:

    | \(\circ\)      | rotation   | reflection |
    |------------+------------+------------|
    | rotation   | rotation   | reflection |
    | reflection | reflection | rotation   |

- Composing a reflection with itself gives the identity symmetry \(e\).
