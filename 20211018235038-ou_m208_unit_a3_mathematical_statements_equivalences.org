+ Equivalence :: A statement of the form "If P, then Q, and if Q, then P"
  * More easily expressed as "P if and only if Q"

An equivalence states that if either of the two elements holds, then the other must hold too.

Equivalences can be expressed in different ways:

 - P \(\iff\) Q
 - P is equivalent to Q
 - P is necessary and sufficient for Q

Equivalences can be tought of as being composed of two [[id:f756858e-424c-405c-969d-b83b35b665d5][OU:M208:Unit-A3:Mathematical Statements:Implications]], "If P, then Q" and "If Q, then P".

Similarly, they can be expressed trough [[id:741ceedd-4492-4600-bb82-e5a69a73b3a2][OU:M208:Unit-A3:Mathematical Statements:The Contrapositive of An Implication]], "If P, then Q" and "If not P, then not Q".
