+ Interval :: Set of real numbers included between two endpoints \(a\) and \(b\)

There are multiple kinds of intervals:

 + Open Interval :: An interval in which both endpoints are excluded

   \(-2 < x < 5\) is written \((-2, 5)\)
 + Closed Interval :: An interval in which both endpoints are included

   \(-2 \le x \le 5\) is written \([-2, 5]\)

 + Half-Open Interval :: An interval in which one endpoint is included and one is excluded.

   \(-2 < x \le 5\) is written \((-2, 5]\)
   \(-2 \le x < 5\) is written \([-2, 5)\)

We use the symbol \(\infty\) when the interval extends indefinitely in the
positive direction and the symbol \(-\infty\) when the interval extends
indefinitely in the negative direction.

We always use round-brackets for the inifinite parts of an interval.

  * The set of all real numbers greater than \(-3\) is \((-3, \infty)\)
  * The set of all real numbers less than or equal to \(4\) is \((-\infty, 4]\)
