Let \(P(x_1, y_1, z_1)\) and \(Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)\) be two points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).

Let \(M\) be the poiunt \((x_2, y_2, z_1)\) then \(M\) must lie in the same horizontal plane as \(P\) and \(MQ\) is parallel to z-axis.

Then, let \(N\) be the poiunt \((x_1, y_2, z_1)\); then \(N\) must also lie in the same horizontal plane as \(P\) and \(MN\) and \(NP\) are parallel, respectively, to the x and y axes.

The triangles \(PQM\) and \(PMN\) are both right-angled triangles with right-angles at, respectively, \(M\) and \(N\).

The length of \(PN\) is \(\left| y2 - y1 \right|\) and the length of \(NM\) is \(\left| x2 - x1 \right|\) .

It follows from /Pythagoras' Theorem/ that:

    \begin{equation*}
    PM^2 = NM^2 + PN^2
    \end{equation*}

So that


    \begin{equation*}
    PM^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
    \end{equation*}

Applying the same theorem again we get that:


    \begin{equation*}
    PQ^2 = PM^2 + MQ^2
    \end{equation*}

And since \(MQ\) is \(\left| z2 - z1 \right|\) we obtain:


    \begin{equation*}
    PQ^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2
    \end{equation*}

That is:

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Distance formula for $\mathbb{R}^3$]
The distance between the two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in the three-dimensional space is

\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\end{equation*}
