#+title: Language Server Protocol:3.16:Basic JSON Structures:Enumerations
#+filetags: :LSP:Tech:Languages:Tooling:Specification:JSON:Enumeration:

The protocol support enumerations of two kinds:

 + Integer Based Enumerations :: Enumerations that usually start at 1.

   Some do not start at 1 for historical reasons and are kept for
   backward compatibilities.

   The set of values available for an enumeration is usually announced
   by the side that defines it (Client or Server) and transmitted
   during the [[id:ea926146-df61-4748-807d-0b51eef341e9][Language Server Protocol:3.16:Actual Protocol:Initialize]]
   handshake.

 + String Based Enumerations :: Collection of named values.

To support forward compatibility, the consuming side of an Enumeration should not fail when receiving an enumeration value that is not known.
Instead, it should ignore it while trying to preserve it between furhter communication.
