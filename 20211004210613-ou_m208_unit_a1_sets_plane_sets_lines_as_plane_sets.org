Consider the line \(l_1\) with gradient \(m\) and y-intercept \(c\).
This line is the set of all points \((x, y)\) for which \(y = mx + c\) holds.

Using set notation we write that \(l_1 = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y = mx + c\}\)
 * Alternatively, we can use an expression for the coordinates.
   For example \(l_1 = \{(x, mx + c) : x \in \mathbb{R}^2\}\)

For a line \(l_2\) that is parallel to the y-axis and with x-intercept
\(a\) we write \({l_2 = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x = a\}\)
