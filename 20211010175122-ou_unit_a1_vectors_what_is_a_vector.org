\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Vector]
A \textbf{vector} is a quantity that is determined by its magnitude and direction.

A \textbf{scalar} is a quantity that is determined by its magnitude.
\end{tcolorbox}


 * An example of such a quantity is /velocity/, where to you need to give both the speed and the direction that something is moving.

A vector can be represented, geometrically, as a line segment with an arrowhead.

 * A vector represented by a line segment from \(A\) to \(B\) with an arrowhead pointing from \(A\) to \(B\) can be written as \(\overrightarrow{AB\)

 * We often use single letters such as *v* to denote a vector.
   Vectors are usually distinguished by either using a *bold* typeface or by underlining the letters such as, \(\underline{v}\).

 * We denote the magnitude of a vector *v* as \(\left| \mathbf{v} \right|\).

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=The Zero Vector]
The \textbf{zero vector} is the vector whose magnitude is zero and whose direction is undefined. It is denoted by the symbol $\mathbf{0}$.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Equality of two Vectors]
Two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are equal if:

\begin{itemize}
\item They have the same magnitude; that is, $\left| \mathbf{a} \right| = \left| \mathbf{a} \right|$
\item They are in the same direction
\end{itemize}

We write $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}$
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=The Negation of a Vector]
The \textbf{negative} of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is the vector that has the same magnitude as $\mathbf{v}$ but the opposite direction.

It is denoted by $-\mathbf{v}$.
\end{tcolorbox}


 * If we write \(\mathbf{v}\) as \(\overrightarrow{AB}\), then \(-\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{BA}\).


\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Scalar Multiple of a Vector]
Let $k$ be a scalar and $\mathbf{v}$ be a vector. The \textbf{scalar multiple} $k\mathbf{v}$ of $\mathbf{v}$ is the vector:

\begin{itemize}
\item Whose magnitude is $\left| k \right|$ times the magnitude of $\mathbf{v}$ such that $\left| k\mathbf{v}\right| = \left|k\right|\left|\mathbf{v}\right|$
\item That has the same direction as $\mathbf{v}$ if $k > 0$ and the opposite direction if $k < 0$
\end{itemize}

If $k = 0$ then $k\matthbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$
\end{tcolorbox}

To add two vectors we can use one of the following laws:

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Triangle Law for Addition of Vectors]
The sum $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}$ of two vectors $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ is obtained as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Starting at any point, draw the vector $\mathbf{p}$
\item Starting from the tip of the vector $\mathbf{p}$, draw the vector $\mathbf{q}$
\end{enumerate}

Then, the sum $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}$ is the vector from the tail of $\mathbf{p}$ to the tip of $\mathbf{q}$.
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Parallelogram Law for Addition of Vectors]
The sum $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}$ of two vectors $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ is obtained as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Starting at the same point, draw the vectors $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$
\item Complete the parallalegram of which these vectors are adjacent sides.
\end{enumerate}

Then, the sum $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}$ is the vector where the tail of $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ meet to the opposite corner of the parallelogram.
\end{tcolorbox}

Addition and scalar multiplication respect the following properties:

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Properties of Vectors Algebra]
Let $\mathbf{p}$, $\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ vectors, and let $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$.
The following properties hold.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Commutativity] $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{p}$
\item[Associativity] $(\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}) + \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} + (\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{r})$
\item[Distributivity]
\begin{align*}
a(\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}) &= a\mathbf{p} + a\mathbf{q} \\
(a + b)\mathbf{p} = a\mathbf{p} + q\mathbf{p}
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

Finally, we can define subtraction over two vectors:

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Difference Between Two Vectors]
The \textbf{difference} $\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}$ of the vectors $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ is

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{p} + (-\mathbf{q})
\end{equation*}
\end{tcolorbox}
