+ Rotation about the centre trough any angle is a symmetry of the disc.
+ Reflection in any line trough the centre is a symmetry of the disc.

- The disc has infinitely many rotational and reflectional symmetries.


For any integer \(k\), rotations trough \(\theta\) and \(\theta + 2k\pi\) produce the same effect.
We can thus reduce the angles of rotations in the interval \([0, 2\pi)\).

Reflection on a line at an angle \(\theta\) to the horizontal produces the same reflection as the one at angle \(\theta + \pi\).
We can thus restrict the angles of axes of reflections to the interval \([0, \pi)\).

The symmetries of a disc thus are:

 + \(r_{\theta}\) :: Rotation trough an angle \(\theta\) along the centre, for \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\)
 + \(q_{\theta}\) :: Reflection in the line trough the centre at an angle \(\theta\) to the horizontal, for \(\theta \in [0, \pi)\)


+ The identity symmetry is the zero rotation.

+ The set of symmetries of the disc is denoted \(S(\bigcirc)\):

  \(S(\bigcirc) = \{r_{\theta} : \theta \in [0, 2\pi)\} \cup \{q_{\theta} : \theta \in [0, \pi)\}\)
