#+title: JSON-RPC:2.0:Batch

A Client may send multiple requests at once by sending an [[id:efb9cf9c-b39d-4400-844d-3d9c7f5d1c18][JSON:Type
System:Array]] filled with [[id:ad9a41bf-e8ca-4db9-b2dd-987786b21a22][JSON-RPC:2.0:Request]] Objects.

Any order may be used for the responses in the array.

The Server should respond with an [[id:efb9cf9c-b39d-4400-844d-3d9c7f5d1c18][JSON:Type System:Array]] containing a
[[id:a42a0131-45f9-4bd2-8727-9bdf29f9674b][JSON-RPC:2.0:Response]] Object for each request.

The Server must not include a response for any sent [[id:7e17801e-eb31-4e80-b723-59d55e62dc05][JSON-RPC:2.0:Request:Notification]].

If the batch fails to be recognized as a valid [[id:a51c2cf3-c79d-464d-bc7e-45c8f44c1734][JSON]] or as an [[id:efb9cf9c-b39d-4400-844d-3d9c7f5d1c18][JSON:Type System:Array]] with at least one value, the Server must responde with a single Response Object.

If there are no Response Object the server must not return an empty
[[id:efb9cf9c-b39d-4400-844d-3d9c7f5d1c18][JSON:Type System:Array]]. Don't return anything instead.

- The Server can process the requests concurrently.
