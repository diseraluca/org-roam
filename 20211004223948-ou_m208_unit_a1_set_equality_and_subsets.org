\begin{tcolorbox}[title=The Equality of Sets]
Two sets $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{equal} if they have exactly the same elements; we write $A = B$.
\end{tcolorbox}

For example, the sets \(A = \{1, -1\}\) and \(B = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x^2 - 1 = 0\}\) are written differently but have exactly the same elements and are thus equal.


\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Subset]
A set $A$ is a \textbf{subset} of a set $B$ if each element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. We also say that $A$ is contained in $B$ and we write $A \subseteq B$.

The converse of this, $A$ is not contained in $B$, is written $A \nsubseteq B$.

For every set $B$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $B$ is a subset of itself, that is $B \subseteq B$.
\item The empty set $\emptyset$ is a subset of $B$, that is $\emptyset \subseteq B$.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

For example \(\{1\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}\).

 * To show that a set is a subset of another set we can either check each element one by one, if the set is small, or check algebraically that a set is contained by the other.
 * To show that a set is not a subset of another set we need to find any element of the set that is not contained by the other set.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Proper Subset]
A set $A$ is a \textbf{proper subset} of a set $B$ if $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$.

We write this as $A \subset B$.
\end{tcolorbox}

 * To show that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ we must show that $A$ is a subset of $B$ and that there is an element in $B$ that is not in $A$.

- To show that two sets are equal:

  * Show that \(A \subseteq B\)
  * Show that $B \subseteq A$
