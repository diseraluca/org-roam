+ Converse :: Given an implication "If P, then Q", its converse is "If Q, then P"

It is possible for an implication to be true, while its converse is false.

For example, consider the implication "If \(x > 2\), then \(x^2 > 4\)".
Its converse is "If \(x^^2 > 4\), then \(x > 2\)".

The original implication is trivially true but its converse is trivially false (consider \(-3\) for example).

This is true for all combinations of truthness.
That is, knowing whether an implication is true or false tells us nothing about its converse.
