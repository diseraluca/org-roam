+ Statement :: An assertion that is either true or false
  * Also called *proposition*
  * Usually denoted by capital letters \(P, Q, R, \ldots\)

+ Variable Proposition :: A statement whose truthness or falseness depends on the value of one or more variables
 * For example : \(x\) is greater than \(0\)
 * Usually denoted by the containing variables \(P(x), Q(x), R(x), \ldots\)

+ Theorem :: A statement that is true
  * Generally reserved for a statement that is of some importance and whose truthness, which is not obvious, is to be proved
  * Sometimes called a Result

+ Proposition :: A theorem that is "less important"
+ Lemma :: A theorem that is used in the proof of other theorems
+ Corollary :: A theorem that follows trivially from another theorem

+ Negation :: A statement related to another statement which is true when the original statement is false and vice versa
