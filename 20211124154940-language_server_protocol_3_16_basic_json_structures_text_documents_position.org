#+title: Language Server Protocol:3.16:Basic JSON Structures:Text Document:Position
#+filetags: :LSP:Tech:Languages:Tooling:Specification:JSON:Documents:Text:Position:Monodimensional:

Represent a position inside a [[id:3f927819-d241-4972-bc15-3dc0b3e44a80][Language Server Protocol:3.16:Basic JSON
Structures:Text Document]].

+ Positions are zero-based line and character offsets.
+ A Position is between two characters similar to the insert mode cursor in an editor.
+ The offsets are calculated based on a [[id:19f49943-24fa-464c-a3eb-bfb8d9392f04][Unicode:UTF-16]] string representation.

  For instance, a string of the form ="aêêÄb"= has the character ~a~ at
  offset 0, the character ~êêÄ~ at offset 1 and the character ~b~ at
  offset 3, since ~êêÄ~ is represented using two code units.

+ To ensure that both client and server split the string in the same
  line representation, the protocol defines the following end-of-line
  sequences:

   * ="\n"=
   * ="\r"=
   * ="\r\n"=

+ Positions are end-of-line character agnostic and it thus impossible
  to specify a position that denotes =\r|\n= or =\n|=, where =|=
  represents the character offset.

A position is an [[id:2b6c48db-b918-46db-86be-d1cbdf5f5bef][JSON:Type System:Object]] that has the following members:

 + line :: A [[id:18188d0a-f0bd-4e20-84c3-5291da9736c6][JSON:Type System:Number]] that has no fractional part and is greater than or equal to 0.

   Represent the line in the document that the position is at.

 + character :: A [[id:18188d0a-f0bd-4e20-84c3-5291da9736c6][JSON:Type System:Number]] that has no fractional part and is greater than or equal to 0.

   Assuming a line that is represented as a string, it represents the
   gap between the `character` value and `character + 1`.

   A character value that is greater than the length of the line
   should be treated as being equal to the length of the line.
