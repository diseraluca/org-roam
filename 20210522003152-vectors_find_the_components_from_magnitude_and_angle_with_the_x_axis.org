+ \(\left| \bm{v} \right| \cos{\theta}\bm{i} + \left| \bm{v} \right| \sin{\theta}\bm{j} \)

Consider any non-zero vector *v*, and let the angle it makes with the positive x-direction be \( \theta \).

Let *u* be the vector with the same direction as *v* but with a magnitude of 1.
Drawing *u* with its tail at the origin, its top will lie on the unit circle.

Then, its tip must have coordinates \(\left(\cos{\theta},\sin{\theta}\right)\), such that \(\bm{u} = \cos{\theta}\bm{i} + \sin{\theta}\bm{j} \).

Then, multiplying *u* by the magnitude of *v*, will give us *v*, thus:

\begin{align*}
\bm{v} &= \left| \bm{v} \right|\left(\cos{\theta}\bm{i} + \sin{\theta}\bm{j}\right) \\
\bm{v} &= \left| \bm{v} \right| \cos{\theta}\bm{i} + \left| \bm{v} \right| \sin{\theta}\bm{j}
\end{align*}
