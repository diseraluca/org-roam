#+title: JSON:Type System:String

A string is a sequence of zero of more unicode characters.

 * A string begins and ends with quotation marks.
 * Any unicode character may be placed withing the quotation marks
   apart from the following characters which must be escaped.

   - Quotation Mark
   - Reverse Solidus
   - [[id:c9b3c1c3-8b19-4be9-b9c6-f7879fd125a6][Unicode:Control Characters:C0]]

Any character may be escaped.
 * Characters in the [[id:db9567c8-bade-416e-a91b-becebf4a6184][Unicode:Basic Multilingual Plane]] can be represented as a six-character sequence:
    - A reverse solidus
    - The lowercase letter u
    - Four hexadecimal digits that encode the character's code point

   For example, a string containing a single reverse solidus can be

   represented as ~"/u005C"~. To simplify the escaping of some popular
   characters some special two-characters sequences are provided.

   Hence, the string containing only a reverse solidus can be represented as ~"\\"~

   Extended characters not in the [[id:db9567c8-bade-416e-a91b-becebf4a6184][Unicode:Basic Multilingual Plane]] are
   represented by a twelve-character sequence when escaped, encoding
   the [[id:19f49943-24fa-464c-a3eb-bfb8d9392f04][Unicode:UTF-16]] surrogate pair.

   For example, a string containing only ùÑû (01D11E) may be represented
   as ~"\uD834\uDD1E"~.
