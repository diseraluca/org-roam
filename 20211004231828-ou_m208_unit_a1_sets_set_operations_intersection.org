\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Set Intersection]
Let $A$ and $B$ be any two sets; then the \textbf{intersection} of $A$ and $B$ is the set

\begin{equation*}
A \cap B = \{x : x \in A\ \text{and}\ x \in B\}
\end{equation*}
\end{tcolorbox}

For example, if \(A = \{2,3,5\}\) and \(B = \{1,2,5,8\}\) then their
intersection, the set of all elements belonging to both \(A\) and
\(B\), is \(\{2,5\}\).

+ Disjoint Sets :: Two sets whose intersection is the empty set.
