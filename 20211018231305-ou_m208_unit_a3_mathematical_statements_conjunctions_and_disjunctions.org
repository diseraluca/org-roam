Statements can be combined in various way.

Two such way are *Conjunctions* and *Disjunctions*.

+ Conjunction :: A compound statement that is true when both of its elements are true and false if at least one of them are false

  * "A and B" is the conjunction of A and B

+ Disjunction :: A compound statement that is true when either one of its elements are true and false if they are both false

  * "A or B" is the disjunction of A and B
